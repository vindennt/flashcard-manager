# Flashcard Application Project

## Premise

The project I wish to create is an application aimed at students that uses user-created flashcards to create
quizzes and provide statistics for users to improve their studying experience. It will let one create decks
with flashcards that have a front and back side, review decks of flashcards, and return basic statistics on which
cards they should study more. Because I believe flash cards are among the most efficient study methods, I wanted
to see how I could implement them in a program and integrate further improvements to their efficiency, such as
user-specific statistics.

## User Stories
The user stories that I wish to fulfill are:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a flashcard to a deck in a collection of decks
- As a user, I want to be able to save my flashcard decks to an external file
- As a user, I want to be able to be tested on the flashcards from a deck of my choice
- As a user, I want to be able to see which flashcards I got incorrect or spent the most time on during testing
