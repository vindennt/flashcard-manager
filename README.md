# Flashcard Application Project

## Premise

The project I wish to create is an application aimed at students that uses user-created flashcards to create
quizzes and provide statistics for users to improve their studying experience. It will let one create decks
with flashcards that have a front and back side, review decks of flashcards, and return basic statistics on which
cards they should study more. Because I believe flash cards are among the most efficient study methods, I wanted
to see how I could implement them in a program and integrate further improvements to their efficiency, such as
user-specific statistics.

## User Stories
### P1: Base program
The user stories that I wish to fulfill are:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a flashcard to a deck in a collection of decks
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a specific flashcard in a deck
- As a user, I want to be able to be tested on the flashcards from a deck of my choice
- As a user, I want to be able to see which flashcards I got incorrect

### P2: Saving and loading

- As a user, I want to be able to save a deck to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to load a deck from a file

## To do:
### P3: Graphical user interface

- [] Include a panel in which all the flashcards that have already been added to a deck are displayed. 
  - Additionally, include 2 related events such as a button to add flashcard to deck, or a filter button. Just make sure its related to flashcards and decks.
- [] Buttons to click for saving and loading, or a pop-up save reminder
- [] Visual component, such as displaying an image when an event occurs, displaying an image in a splash screen when your  application starts, or displaying a graph to represent some aspect of the user's data
  - Painting panels, buttons and menu items in different colours does not count
- [] Documentation requirements

### Instructions for Grader
List step by step instructions for interacting with the GUI
- how to generate the first of the two required events that are related to the required user story "add multiple Xs to a Y" (e.g., click the button labelled "Add an X", or select the menu item labelled "Add an X", or type <ctrl>+N on the keyboard to add an X,...)
- how to generated the second of the two required events
- where to find the visual component that was added to your project (e.g., background image, image added to button)
- how does the user save the state of the application to file
- how does the user load the state of the application from file  

Use template below:

- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by...
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by...
- You can locate my visual component by...
- You can save the state of my application by...
- You can reload the state of my application by...
